-----------------
GMAIL SYNC ENGINE
-----------------

Gmail is theoretically an IMAP backend, but it differs enough from standard
IMAP that we handle it differently. The state-machine rigamarole noted in
.imap.py applies, but we change a lot of the internal algorithms to fit Gmail's
structure.

Gmail has server-side threading, labels, and all messages are a subset of the
'All Mail' folder.

The only way to delete messages permanently on Gmail is to move a message to
the trash folder and then EXPUNGE.

We use Gmail's thread IDs locally, and download all mail via the All Mail
folder. We expand threads when downloading folders other than All Mail so the
user always gets the full thread when they look at mail.
